The data file is provided for the data about the areas that are affected by a Natural
phenomenon such as hurricane or fire. There is some information about the environment in the data file.
The explanation of the columns is provided in the following part. The goal is to predict the area that might
be affected based on the features. You need to prepossess the data, make visualizations and statistical
summary reports. The primary approach would be fitting a regression model for prediction the area that
will be affected. You might also have a second approach to the problem as a classification problem that
concludes if the area will be affected or not.
